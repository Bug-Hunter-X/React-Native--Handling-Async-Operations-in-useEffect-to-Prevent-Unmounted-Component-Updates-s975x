This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with an asynchronous operation inside.  If the asynchronous operation (e.g., fetching data from an API) is not properly handled, it might lead to unexpected behavior or crashes after component unmount. The issue stems from the fact that the component might be unmounted before the asynchronous operation completes, resulting in attempts to update the state or access components that no longer exist, leading to warnings or errors like `Cannot update a component from an unmounted component`.
